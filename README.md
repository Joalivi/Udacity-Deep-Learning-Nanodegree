These are my five projects implemented during the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.
## 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Data

<p>
In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a 
Bike Sharing Dataset.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project

<p>
In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## 3. Generate TV Scripts

<p>
In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. 
I used a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I  built generated a new, "fake" TV script.
</p>

## 4.Face Generation

<p>
In this project, I used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new images of faces.
</p>

## 5. SageMaker deployment project (AWS SageMaker)

<p>
In this project, I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. 
In addition, I deployed my model and construct a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
